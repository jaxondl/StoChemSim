### pre-data comments
#Up to *three* complete empty lines (meaning no text at all, comments or otherwise) are allowed before the data, like so:



4 5 #first number is the number of reaction lines below (here it is 4 b/c the next 4 lines are reaction lines), second number is the number of simulations to run
2A 3B -> 4z 5.2 #reaction index is 0 for this reaction
4Uj0+ B <-> 3A 1.1 2.3 #since this is a reversible reaction, its forward direction will be reaction index 1, and its reverse direction will be reaction index 2
0 -> 2A 3B 7
3z -> 0 4.3
